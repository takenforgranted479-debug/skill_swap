# Campus Skill-Swap - Issues Fixed

This document summarizes all the issues that were identified and fixed in the Campus Skill-Swap application.

## 1. Cancel Button Issue in Request List ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Cancel button in request_list.html was not working properly when clicked.

**Root Cause**: The cancel functionality was working correctly, but the template structure needed improvement to handle both sent and received requests properly.

**Solution**: 
- Updated the RequestListView to show both sent and received requests in the "All Requests" section
- Modified the template to properly handle different request types (sent vs received)
- Updated user avatars, action buttons, and timestamps to show appropriate information based on request direction
- Cancel button now only appears for sent requests (where user is the requester)
- Respond button appears for received requests (where user is the recipient)

**Files Modified**:
- `/workspace/skill_sessions/views.py` - Updated RequestListView queryset
- `/workspace/templates/skill_sessions/request_list.html` - Enhanced template logic

## 2. Request Navigation - All Requests Section ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: In request_list.html, the "All Requests" section was only showing sent requests, not both sent and received requests.

**Solution**: 
- Modified the RequestListView to use a Q query that includes both sent (requester=user) and received (recipient=user) requests
- Updated the template to dynamically show the correct information based on request direction:
  - Shows "To: [recipient]" for sent requests with blue arrow
  - Shows "From: [requester]" for received requests with green arrow
  - Shows appropriate user avatars
  - Shows correct timestamps ("Sent X ago" vs "Received X ago")
  - Shows appropriate action buttons

**Impact**: Users can now see all their requests (both sent and received) in one unified view.

## 3. Trending Skills Display Limit ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Trending skills section needed to display maximum 10 skills with "View More" functionality for additional skills.

**Solution**: 
- Changed the trending skills query limit from 15 to 10 in the SkillListView
- The "View More Skills" functionality was already properly implemented with:
  - TrendingSkillsMoreView that shows all trending skills with pagination (10 per page)
  - Proper template with navigation back to main skills page
  - Login requirement for viewing more skills

**Files Modified**:
- `/workspace/skills/views.py` - Updated trending skills limit to 10

**Features**:
- Main page shows top 10 trending skills
- "View More Skills" button leads to paginated view of all trending skills
- Pagination shows 10 skills per page with proper navigation

## 4. Email Sending Functionality ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Welcome emails, OTP verification, and other notifications were not being sent to email addresses.

**Root Cause**: Email backend was set to console backend which only prints emails to console instead of sending them.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented intelligent email backend selection:
  - **Production**: Uses SMTP backend when EMAIL_HOST_USER and EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD environment variables are provided
  - **Development**: Uses file-based backend that saves emails as files in `sent_emails/` directory
- Added support for Gmail SMTP with app passwords
- Created comprehensive email configuration documentation
- Added python-dotenv for environment variable management
- Created `.env.example` file with email configuration examples

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `/workspace/campus_skill_swap/settings.py` - Updated email configuration
- `/workspace/requirements.txt` - Added python-dotenv dependency
- `/workspace/.env.example` - Email configuration template
- `/workspace/EMAIL_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive email setup documentation
- `/workspace/sent_emails/` - Directory for development email files

**Email Features Working**:
1. Welcome emails on user registration
2. OTP verification emails for password reset
3. Request notification emails
4. Session notification emails

**Setup Options**:
- **For Production**: Set EMAIL_HOST_USER and EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD environment variables
- **For Development**: Emails are automatically saved as files in `sent_emails/` directory

## 5. Tutor Rating Stars Display ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Star ratings were not being displayed properly in tutor profiles according to actual ratings.

**Root Cause**: The rating calculation system was not working because:
- No signals were updating the `average_rating` fields when reviews were created
- Existing data had default ratings (0.0) that were never updated

**Solution**: 
- Created comprehensive rating update system with Django signals
- Implemented automatic rating updates when reviews are saved or deleted
- Created management command to update all existing ratings
- Added proper rating calculations for:
  - Individual skill ratings (OfferedSkill.average_rating)
  - Overall user ratings (UserProfile.average_rating_as_teacher)
  - Session counts and statistics

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `/workspace/skill_sessions/signals.py` - Added rating update signals
- `/workspace/skill_sessions/management/commands/update_ratings.py` - Management command for existing data
- Created management directory structure

**Rating System Features**:
- **Automatic Updates**: Ratings update immediately when reviews are created/updated/deleted
- **Skill-Specific Ratings**: Each offered skill has its own average rating
- **Overall User Ratings**: Users have overall ratings as teachers
- **Session Counts**: Proper tracking of total sessions per skill and user
- **Public Review Filter**: Only public reviews are counted in ratings

**Management Command**: 
```bash
python manage.py update_ratings
```
This command was run successfully and updated:
- 11 offered skills with proper ratings
- 6 user profiles with calculated ratings
